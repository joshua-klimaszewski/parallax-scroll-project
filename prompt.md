## Feedback Summary - Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed the double scrollbar issue
- Set `overflow: hidden` on both the html and body elements
- Made only the parallax container scrollable with `overflow-y: auto`

#### 2. Added proper scroll snapping
- Added `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` to the container
- Added `scroll-snap-align: center` to each layer

#### 3. Improved content centering
- Updated the ParallaxLayer component to center content both horizontally and vertically
- Added a section-content class to provide proper spacing and positioning
- Removed redundant height and positioning styles from individual content components

#### 4. Enhanced transition effects
- Improved the scaling, opacity, and translation calculations based on scroll position
- Made transitions smoother by using distance from the middle of each section
- Updated transition timing functions for more fluid animations

#### 5. Updated scroll position tracking
- Modified useScrollPosition hook to track the container's scrollTop instead of window.scrollY

### Results
- Content transitions smoothly between sections
- Sections snap properly to the center of the viewport
- Only one scrollbar is visible at a time
- Content is properly centered in each section

### Next Steps
- Consider tweaking the transition effects by adjusting:
  - Speed values in HomePage.tsx 
  - Transform calculations in ParallaxLayer.tsx
- Can refine transitions further by examining them individually

## Code Implementations

```tsx
// Key transition calculation in ParallaxLayer.tsx
const distanceFromMiddle = (offset - sectionMiddle) / window.innerHeight;
    
// Scale: from 0.8 when far to 1 when centered
const newScale = 0.8 + (1 - Math.min(1, Math.abs(distanceFromMiddle))) * 0.2;
    
// Opacity: full opacity when centered, fades as we scroll away
const newOpacity = 0.3 + (1 - Math.min(1, Math.abs(distanceFromMiddle) * 1.2)) * 0.7;
    
// Translate: create parallax effect
const newTranslateY = distanceFromMiddle * speed * window.innerHeight * -0.1;
```
